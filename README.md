# Marahuyo — Fragrance Experience

A re-developed training module based on my original project: an immersive, narrative-driven e-commerce experience for a fragrance brand. It explores “Ethereal Brutalism”—a fusion of light, atmospheric elements with raw, structural brutalism—shaping its distinct visuals and unconventional user flows.
